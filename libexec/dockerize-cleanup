# Usage: dockerize cleanup x seconds|hours|days|hours|weeks|months [filter]
#
# Summary: Delete containers older than a specific time period, supports filtering
#
# Help: Claims back some of the disk space used by older Docker containers
#
#    dockerize cleanup 1 week
#
# Restrict containers to an identifier (eg. IMAGE, COMMAND, STATUS etc.)
#
# Delete all containers older than 1 hour with "Exit 127" exit status:
#   dockerize cleanup 1 hour Exit 127
#
# Delete all containers older than 7 days matching "echo foobar" command:
#   dockerize cleanup 7 days echo foobar
