## v0.2.0 - 2013/11

Now that we can bring up Docker containers that depend on other
containers, we need to add an extra, 3rd level:

<pre>
proxy (nginx, haproxy etc.) &lt;- 3rd level container
|
|- ruby_app_1               &lt;- 2nd level container
|  |
|  |- redis_server_1        &lt;- 1st level container
|  |- postgresql_server_1   &lt;- 1st level container
|
|- ruby_app_2               &lt;- 2nd level container
   |
   |- redis_server_2        &lt;- 1st level container
</pre>

#### FEATURES

* `boot` uses `.dockerize.containers` to call itself recursively
* `boot` uses `.docker.containers` for dependent Docker containers
* `boot` uses `docker.envs` files for environment variables that
  need to be forwarded into containers

#### BUG FIXES

* `boot` now fails correctly if an intermediary run command fails
* `boot` no longer checks for envs or containers if not dealing with a
  GitHub repository as there is no dir to cd into.

## v0.1.0 - 2013/10

Introducing support for Docker containers that depend on other
containers such as a Ruby app needing a Redis and a PostgreSQL server.
These needed to be built from GitHub. While at it, automating git
credentials caching was a simple problem to solve.

Extracting specific container attributes such as the IPAddress was
essential in creating the simplest container discovery implementation.
[etcd](https://github.com/coreos/etcd) and
[serf](https://github.com/hashicorp/serf) would make a lot more sense,
but I needed the most straightforward solution that wouldn't involve any
dependencies.

An efficient way of removing unnecessary Docker containers and reclaim
some of the disk space was a low-hanging fruit.

#### FEATURES

* `boot` start Docker container from image, manages dependent Docker
  containers
* `cleanup` delete containers (running or not) older than a specific
  time period, supports filtering
* `envs` docker run friendly environment variables
* `github` build Docker images from GitHub repository
* `list` list all containers (running or not), supports filtering
* `show` show all or specific ontainer attributes
